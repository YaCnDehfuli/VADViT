# VADViT: Vision Transformer-Driven Malware Detection using VAD Regions

This repository contains the codebase for the **VADViT** framework, which converts Virtual Address Descriptor (VAD) regions from memory dumps into an RGB grid of images and applies a Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect malicious processes. The approach and dataset are described in detail in our paper (citation below). However, this README is dedicated to helping users run and navigate the code.

> **Note**:  
> The dataset containing raw memory dumps (BCCC-MalMem-SnapLog-2025) is **not** publicly distributed here. It is available upon request. See the [Dataset Availability](#dataset-availability) section for details.

### `data_preprocessing/`
All code related to reading, transforming, and merging the raw memory dump data into a form suitable for model training. It contains **two main subfolders**:

1. **`dumps_to_consolidated/`**  
   - This reads in the **five memory dumps** per sample (each dump contains data for a single process, typically identified by the malware PID).  
   - Extracts individual VAD regions from each dump.  
   - Aggregates these regions into a *consolidated set* representing the malware process over time.

2. **`consolidated_to_grid/`**  
   - Takes the *consolidated* VAD regions as input.  
   - Generates the Markov, entropy, and intensity images for each region.  
   - Fuses these into RGB images and arranges them into a grid to form one final “process-level” image.

Each subfolder has its **own main script** (e.g., `main_dumps_to_consolidated.py` and `main_consolidated_to_grid.py`). **They must be run separately** in the correct order to produce the final image dataset for training.

> **Important**: The preprocessing stage **does not** directly invoke any training code. After you finish these steps, you’ll have a folder of grid images ready for model training.

### `training/`
Contains scripts and utilities for **building, training, and evaluating** the Vision Transformer on the generated grid images:
- `models/vit_model.py` (or similarly named): Defines the ViT architecture or integrates an existing implementation.  
- `utils/`: Helper modules (e.g., data loading, augmentation, metrics).  
- `main_training.py`: The main entry point to train and evaluate the model.  
 
> **Note**: This training code **does not** generate or modify any memory dumps. It expects preprocessed image data from the steps described above.

## Prerequisites

1. **Operating System**: Linux or Windows (tested primarily on Linux).  
2. **Python 3.7+**  
3. **CUDA Toolkit** (if training on a GPU).  
4. **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for Python libraries (e.g., `PyTorch`, `Pillow`, `NumPy`, `pandas`, etc.).

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Overview

Below is the high-level workflow for using this code.

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

1. **Organize Memory Dumps**  
   Place your raw memory dump files in a suitable directory. Each process should ideally have **five** memory dumps (named or organized by PID and time step).

2. **Run `dumps_to_consolidated/` Scripts**  
   - Enter the `dumps_to_consolidated/` directory.  
   - Check `main_dumps_to_consolidated.py` for input paths and parameter settings.  
   - Execute:  
     ```bash
     python main_dumps_to_consolidated.py
     ```  
   - This step extracts per-dump VAD regions and combines them into a consolidated dataset (one folder/file per process).

3. **Output**  
   - A consolidated set of VAD regions stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV files or pickled data) for each process.

### Step 2: Generating Grid Images

1. **Run `consolidated_to_grid/` Scripts**  
   - Enter the `consolidated_to_grid/` directory.  
   - Update the input path in `main_consolidated_to_grid.py` to point to the consolidated regions from the previous step.  
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     python main_consolidated_to_grid.py
     ```  
   - This script:
     1. Reads each consolidated region set.  
     2. Converts each region into three images (Markov, Entropy, Intensity).  
     3. Fuses them into a single RGB image.  
     4. Places multiple region-images into a grid layout, resulting in a single “process-level” image for each sample.

2. **Output**  
   - A directory containing final `.png` (or `.jpg`) images that represent each process over the memory snapshots.

### Step 3: Training the Vision Transformer

1. **Prepare your Dataset Splits**  
   - The final grid images can be divided into train/validation/test subsets. The splitting can be done manually or via included utilities in `training/utils/`.

2. **Configure and Run `main_training.py`**  
   - Edit any paths or hyperparameters in `main_training.py` (or in the associated `utils/train_utils.py`).  
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     cd training/
     python main_training.py
     ```  
   - Training logs, model checkpoints, and evaluation metrics are saved according to your configuration.

3. **Output**  
   - Trained model weights.  
   - Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, etc.

## Dataset Availability

- The memory dumps and the full BCCC-MalMem-SnapLog-2025 dataset are **not** included in this repository due to size and legal constraints.  
- If you wish to obtain the dataset, please contact us with a request. We may require proof of research intentions and an appropriate usage agreement.
